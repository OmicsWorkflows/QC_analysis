Description: Peak Detection in Mass Spectrometry data is one of the important
 preprocessing steps. The performance of peak detection affects subsequent
 processes, including protein identification, profile alignment and biomarker
 identification. Using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), this package provides
 a reliable algorithm for peak detection that does not require any type of
 smoothing or previous baseline correction method, providing more consistent
 results for different spectra. See <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl355} for further
 details.
