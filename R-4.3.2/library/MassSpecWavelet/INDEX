findLocalMaxWinSize     Find local maxima and return the size of the
                        window where they are maximum.
getLocalMaximumCWT      Identify the local maximum of each column in
                        2-D CWT coefficients matrix
getRidge                Identify ridges based on the local maximum
                        matrix
getRidgeLength          Estimate the length of the ridge
getRidgeValue           Get the CWT coefficient values corresponding to
                        the peak ridge
identifyMajorPeaks      Identify peaks based on the ridges in 2-D CWT
                        coefficient matrix
localMaximum            Identify local maximum within a slide window.
