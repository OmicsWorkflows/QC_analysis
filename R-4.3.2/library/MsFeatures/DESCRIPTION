Package: MsFeatures
Title: Functionality for Mass Spectrometry Features
Version: 1.10.0
Description: The MsFeature package defines functionality for Mass Spectrometry
    features. This includes functions to group (LC-MS) features based on some
    of their properties, such as retention time (coeluting features), or
    correlation of signals across samples. This packge hence allows to group
    features, and its results can be used as an input for the `QFeatures`
    package which allows to aggregate abundance levels of features within each
    group. This package defines concepts and functions for base and common data
    types, implementations for more specific data types are expected to be
    implemented in the respective packages (such as e.g. `xcms`). All
    functionality of this package is implemented in a modular way which allows
    combination of different grouping approaches and enables its re-use in
    other R packages.
